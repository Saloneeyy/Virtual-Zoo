# Virtual-Zoo
Virtual Zoo mini-project in Java showcasing OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism &amp; interfaces. Features include adding animals, viewing details, and simulating actions (walk, swim, eat) via an interactive console menu.

This is a Java console-based project that simulates a small zoo environment. The goal of the project is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces in a practical way.

The zoo lets you add animals, view the list of animals, and interact with them. Each animal has its own behaviors (walking, swimming, flying, eating) which are implemented using interfaces and overridden methods. The program runs in a menu-driven format where the user can choose different actions.
